//data types have two types: primitive and non-primitive

//primitive data types are: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint

//non-primitive data types are: object, array, function

// in primitive value can be change but not referance will change 

// in non-primitive value can be change and referance will also change. becsuse non-primitive data types are stored in heap memory and primitive data types are stored in stack memory.// when we call any data type premitive will provide the value change facility but non-primitive will provide the reference change facility. 

//falsy values are: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN

//truthy values are: true, any number other than 0, any string other than "", [], {}, function(){}

// null versus undefined

// null is an assignment value. it can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value

// undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value

// implicit type conversion
// console.log('5'+5); //55
// console.log('5'-5); //0
// console.log('5'*5); //25
// console.log('5'/5); //1
// console.log('5'%5); //0

// hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase before the code is executed. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.
